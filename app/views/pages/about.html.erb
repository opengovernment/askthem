  <h1>About AskThem</h1>
  <div class="related_data">
    <p>AskThem is a free, open-source, non-profit and non-partisan platform for questions and petitions with public figures. AskThem is a project of the Participatory Politics Foundation, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization with a mission to increase civic engagement. AskThem's development was supported by a charitable grant from the Knight Foundation's Tech For Engagement initiative. AskThem offers open data for the public benefit. We seek to change the civic culture to ask more, and better, questions of people in power.</p>
	<p>AskThem is the first free & open-source website that allows visitors to simply enter a street address, and then displays all of their elected officials: federal, state, county, and municipal levels of government. AskThem is a platform for open public dialogue and greater public accountability with elected officials and any public figure with a verified Twitter account.</p>
	<p>AskThem developers include: PPF, Open North, Civic Agency, and DataMade LLC. AskThem's Advisory Council oversees our non-profit mission to support a community ethos of good questions.
